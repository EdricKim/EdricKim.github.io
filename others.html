                We're no strangers to love<br>
                You know the rules and so do I<br>
                A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
                You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
                <br>
                I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
                Gotta make you understand<br>
                <br>
                Never gonna give you up<br>
                Never gonna let you down<br>
                Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
                Never gonna make you cry<br>
                Never gonna say goodbye<br>
                Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
                <br>
                We've known each other for so long<br>
                Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
                Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
                We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br>
                <br>
                And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
                Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
                <br>
